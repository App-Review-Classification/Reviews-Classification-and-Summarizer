Since Purchase:

1. Easy to setup
2. Windows 11 Home, Office 2021 (life time validity)
3. Super fast
4. Excellent display with warm color setting to block off the blue light
5. Fast charging

Very happy with my purchase ..."
1,4,Good laptop,"This is a good laptop for students only, not for heavy tasking, gaming, or video editing only basic purpose of multitasking and basic video editing, overall a good laptop. All specs & performance good but compromise with display because it have not a ips display, it comes with anti glare but better than TFT display.
Now companies are not making powerful laptops, due to making them more light weight, now many laptops are not very durable and powerful, but this laptop is fine from Rs 50 to Rs 54000 because it has i5 13th generation processor.
You can go for this laptop in 50 to 53k, 54k
* Now i'm using this laptop from 6 months, this laptop have heating issue, This laptop gets heat after minimal use, I don't play any games, only basic multitasking. In summer days gets like over heat, & in cold days normal heat."
2,5,good product,prompt service. Battery life etc. can only be commented upon after use for a certain period.
3,1,Most disappointing,"I recently purchased the HP laptop Model #FQ5330TU, and unfortunately, my experience has been quite disappointing. From the moment I powered it on, I noticed a significant delay in startup time, making the initial user experience frustrating. Even after allowing it time to settle in, the performance remained sluggish, lacking the responsiveness expected from a modern device.Surprisingly, this sluggishness persisted despite not installing any additional software or apps. It's perplexing to encounter such poor performance on a clean system, indicating deeper underlying issues with the hardware or optimization. Furthermore, the keyboard layout feels outdated, with keys awkwardly placed, leading to discomfort and decreased typing efficiency. This oversight reflects a lack of attention to detail and a failure to keep up with contemporary design standards. The battery life is another major letdown, failing to provide adequate usage time on a single charge. This limitation severely hampers the laptop's portability and usability, especially for users who rely on long hours of uninterrupted work or entertainment. Moreover, the laptop's tendency to heat up quickly is concerning, as it not only affects user comfort but also raises questions about its long-term durability and performance. The accompanying noise generated by the overheating further adds to the overall unpleasant experience, disrupting concentration and indicating potential cooling system inefficiencies. Overall, the laptop falls short in several key areas, including performance, design, battery life, and thermal management. For users seeking a reliable and efficient computing experience, I would recommend looking elsewhere until these issues are addressed."
4,5,Laptop Review,"Laptop is excellent and easy to handle. Good for personal and office work. Display, Battery, Screen Quality is excellent. I don't see any defect since using from last 1 month from. Everything depends how you handle and use there are too many positive and negative comments. I will always positive about this laptop."

11,3,Good,Battery Backup is maximum 90min other wise all components are best
12,4,Battery backup is not good,Battery backup is between 2-2.5 hrs

19,2,Waste of money,The machine often gets switched off in the middle for no reason . It is also very slow in responding .
20,4,Slim and sleek Design,Working properly
21,1,Received Refurbished laptop,"After one month usage of HP laptop, it's restarted automatically several times without any further notification. After 2 months of purchase during same issue one day it's not getting Switch ON.I took to the nearby shop they showed me it was something written in bar code indicates it was refurbished products not new one, some screw are missing in back side of Laptop. They told me that mostly One Screw was replaced with black colour instead of Ash colour screw. He confirmed 100% it was not a new laptop fully refurbished one and mentioned complaint as Display chip got faulty.

Totally disappointed after hearing this information, they cheated me more on this product and wasted my money after buying this product.

Even I'm not getting any proper Customer service support.

Please consider my request to refund my money or replace new product for the same, thanks."

24,5,Laptop,Very Good
25,1,Shuts down on its own. Loses battery and gets hot quickly,"I have been using this product for more than one month now. Speed & low weight is a positive. However, the laptop switches off or hangs on its own even if slightly moved while working. It keeps on losing battery very quickly even if its shut (not shut down) and becomes hot while doing so. The performance is much below satisfactory"
26,3,Good product,Good product but you should add more offers for other cards also
27,4,Product Review,"I am using this HP pavilion laptop for past one week. Build quality is very good and look wise nice. But could be better on the air ventilation because it has designed under So it's generating a heat at short period of time. Keyboard, screen resolution and softwares are much better. For personal use like working, storing data, installing softwares and watching videos I would suggest this laptop."

29,5,Good one,Good Product
30,4,Spend some more and buy better,"From a professional perspective: If you are spending 50K you will expect this laptop to work magic but it won’t. Its processor is slightly slower than expected. I would suggest you to spend extra 8-10k and go for a much faster choice.

From a student perspective: it’s everything you’ll need for your study, assignment, browsing, data backup, sound, gaming. It’s a good fit for 3-4 years of college."

Overall, no issues found.

39,1,Screen heating issue,"I bought this in Rs
46k during sale.
Below review is after 5 days of usage.

Cons-
Air vent is located just below the screen which the causing the screen to heat up in just minutes of usage. This is an extremely bad design to place air vent below the screen instead of side of laptop.
Also,the camera quality is very poor.

59,1,FAULTY DEFECTIVE HARDWARE ISSUE DELIVERED,"I had the worst experience with HP, this is the first and last time I’m buying HO laptop. Broke customer trust by delivering faulty defective piece to me with hardware issues. And not even fixing this issue under warranty. I faced issues from day one with loose keys and faulty mouse pad. In one week the tab key came out. HP is telling me I’ve to pay for it with my own money and not under warranty because this is customer induced damage!! Asking customer to pay for fixing faulty piece delivered to me is heights!! Just terrible and pathetic. Don’t buy this unreliable laptop and from HP. Pathetic customer support."
