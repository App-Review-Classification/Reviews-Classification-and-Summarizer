Gets a little warm while charging as of 17.4.1 update.
When using camera outside for about 40 min it got a little warm. Hopefully Apple will fix it in the latter updates.
Games like Genshin, Free fire, and pubg all run like butter. For Genshin expect the heat since it is heavy.
Rest all is well optimised, it took me a little while to adjust from android"

However, the lack of a high refresh rate display and the underwhelming charging speed hold it back from being truly exceptional.

Pros:
Superb Cameras: The 48MP main sensor captures stunning photos with excellent detail and dynamic range. Low-light performance is also impressive. ...
