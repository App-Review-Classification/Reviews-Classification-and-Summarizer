50,5,ONE OF THE BEST PURCHASE OF MINE:),"Pros

Outstanding design - sturdy and water-proofed.

Bright OLED screen, HDR10, Dolby Vision.

Dependable battery life.

Loud stereo speakers, excellent output.

Unmatched performance, 5G.

Great all-round photo and video quality across all three cameras.

Cons

Minor upgrade over iPhone 12.

No 120Hz refresh rate.

The notch is still an eyesore even if smaller.

The fast charging can be handled better.

iOS (with its limitations) remains a love it or leave it affair."

iPhones is the familiarity that they bring to the

732,5,Brilliant,"Had been sceptical to switch to ios from so long. Shifted only when i was satisfied with the battery performance. In all other parameters, apple wins hands down. This is a great device in all parameters if u are happy with ios. iPhone 13 is a great device with almost everything perfect. If u are not in flaunting pro models or are not a professional photographer skip the pro model as this is almost same in terms of daily usage and is a vfm model in 50 to 55k bracket."

Everything here is top notch quality, the build, design, camera's, battery life and display.
I don't want to mention any pros because everything is good here.
I just feel that the camera in terms of zoom could have been way better, don't get me wrong camera is absolutely the best but it lacks telephoto lens due to which zoom quality produced after taking a shot is not that good. Details are hit...
