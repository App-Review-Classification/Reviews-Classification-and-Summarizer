0,,Most recommend for buying.,Good laptop for daily uses and school works
1,,Good for student and business purposes,"This is the first day use of this laptop...it looks good with light weight metal body..the charging capacity is good,it can recharge in less than an hour and there is no heating issues as of now..the battery may last upto 3 hours from its maximum level..the display and sound is fine with this price level..as students and business persons may not require this features at best but it is okay with this level..the keyboard is also good without backlit and quality of this laptop is good..the appearance is very good with sleek design and the metal body was very great.. overall the laptop is very nice at this price range"
2,,"Works great with Windows, ok with Linux","I purchased this mainly because of the support for an in-built SATA port. This was the only one available with SATA port and reasonably recent CPU and a reasonable price. On that front, it is great.

However, I wanted to use it with Linux, and on that front I took a huge risk. Luckily, almost everything works fine on Linux. However, suspend to RAM doesn't work. To go into details, the BIOS doesn't support S3 sleep. It only supports S0x sleep, support for which is only beginning to mature in Linux. I am currently forced to use hibernate, which is slower."
3,,Automatic turned off and now blank screen,Its been only 3 months since i bought this laptop and facing issue with blank screen when turning on and nothing comes up i tried to reach costomer server they said me.to.try few ways but nothing worked . Its still under warranty period lets see how long it take for.them to resolve this i suggest you not to buy this product unless you wanna face the same issue or related one .
4,,Average product,"It's not bad, but not good either. I bought it for 38,990. I was getting the same price for some other acer laptop with intel i5 1155g7 processor and IPS display, but I missed the deal. So, I bought this ‚òπÔ∏è.

Pros:
1- Performance is not an issue. Decent performance for most of the tasks.
2- Didn't do gaming, so not sure of that. But for programming, it's good.
3- Good for multitasking.
4- Audio is good. It's not loud, but sufficient and it comes with Nahimic audio (for which you will have to download it's app) which enhances it's audio capabilities. Audio can be optimised for different purpose.
5- Sufficient ports. Also have type C port.
6- It has control center to control fan speed, external keyboard light, manage fan speed, power.
7- Battery is decent and can last 4-5 hours on regular workload. But on heavy workload, it will last around 2-2.5 hours.
8- Lookwise it is good.
9- lifetime windows 11 home.

Cons:
1- Although display is antiglare FHD. It's not IPS, so it looks crisp but average. It's just ok for the purpose of coding or regular tasks where we just want the work to be done. Since viewing angle are bad, so for entertainment, it's good for single person for watching movies but not for multiple people. Display is not good for graphic designer who needs color accuracy.
2- There is no backlit keyboard. So, if you want backlit, connect external keyboard with backlit.
3- Although it has an SSD, I didn't find the boot time to be faster. It is fast but didn't meet my expectations.
4- Graphic card is not dedicated which is just good for normal work. I don't think you will enjoy gaming on it. It can play light games but surely you won't enjoy gaming on such system. And it won't able to play high demanding games.
5- Doesn't have activated ms office. You will have to buy it's keys.

Note:
You can install a separate harddisk (HDD) for storing data. Screws are provided with laptop.

For me, the bottom side became very hot and fans started making noise, when it first arrived and I was installing windows updates on it first used it on my bed, that is without proper ventilation. But with proper air flow, it doesn't heat.

Conclusion:
If you are limited on budget and only want your work to be done and doesn't care much about display quality or back lit keyboard or you aren't a gamer, you can buy it.
And if you already bought it, don't regret your decision. It's a ok laptop for most of the task and will get your work done.

UPDATE:- It hangs in middle, and everything stops working not even power button unless I press it for long time to force shutdown.....all my work was lost and mind you I was not doing a heavy task that it couldn't handle, simple web browsing and it stopped in middle, nothing worked....really frustrated..... Don't know if it was windows 11 issue or due to cheap hardware of this machine,ü•πüò°"
5,,Best price,Good performance
6,,Poor service center,"I bought this laptop about 10 months ago,I have to say the laptop performance is good,great upgrade options, but have note that acer service quality is poor I live in Pune and the have only on service center,no pickup available, I didn't like the customer care as they didn't provide me with the solution,I am disappointed üòû with the brand after sale service . Literally pathatic."

If you want ram and storage go for it.

9,,"It's a good laptop, but I was hoping for a backlit keyboard.","The other variants of thr same model had a backlit keyboard, but this one doesn't have it. That was the only reason I subtracted a star. Otherwise, I'm satisfied so far."
10,,Best for students,Nice quality
11,,Excellent,"Good laptop in this price segment
Body is good
Less weight
Screen is good
You can go for it if you're willing for a budget laptop, for everyday use."
12,,Rizen 7,Almost good
13,,"Worth the money,Good product","Acer laptop is good looking and performance also satisfying and processor ryzen 5 runs smoothly, specifications are good,good for home and office use."
14,,No pre installed ms software.,"It does not come with pre installed Microsoft software.customer want to spend extra amount about Rs 8000 to install original MS software. so it is better to buy a laptop which comes with lifetime installed ms software.
So this one is not cheap than other brands."
15,,Good performance laptop,"Good performance laptop but build quality is little to flimsy side otherwise it's doing great , running hardcore softwares games in it"
16,,Good product considering price,Purchased it 4 Months ago at 34k price no problem at all.
17,,Backlite keyboard not working,Backlite keyboard app not working as mentioned in the manual
18,,At this price performance is Good,"1) Performance in terms of working is good at this price.
2) Look and colour is pretty.
3) Battery life is also good
4) Heat is the problem."
19,,Initial Review,"Laptop arrived in good condition, the outer packing had some bumps and cuts (I hope Amazon add a foam lining next time around since it's an electronic product) the tape was damaged and I had assumed possible temperament, but the inner package was safe and sealed.

Setting up the laptop right now and I don't see issues except for the display having variable lighting zones.
Speakers are alright, keyboard feels alright for office/school work.

Seeing it has a Ryzen 5 5K series chipset, I belive it can run gaming titles up to 2019-2020s at the lowest settings. Though i recommend you that you buy a gaming laptop if you're looking for the exact application.

I'll update the review after a week of use.

Update*
I've noticed the fan sounds like a jet engine at times. I guess it's a norm for the cheap price but it would've been better if the engineers could come up with grated outlet at the back, we don't mind if there's a gab between the display and the body.

The display is below avg. Not recommended for someone who wants to do work related to colour perfection unless you but an expensive external display.

And as for the gaming aspect, It can run tomb rider 2019 at an avg of 30-40 fps at lowest graphics. If you're alright with that then go ahead with the purchase."
20,,Budget laptop with sleep issues and poor support,"I bought this as a second portable laptop. I use a more powerful one as my desktop replacement. Let's go through the clich√©d pros and cons, shall we?
Before that I should mention the biggest issue I've had with this. It DOES NOT enter sleep state correctly.
The fan keeps spinning in windows and this will be a drain in the sleep state. There's NO updated BIOS as of now to fix that. In Linux it just hangs after trying to wake up from sleep.

Pros:
1. Good price
2. Surprisingly good build quality except for the keyboard which feels cheap
3. Decent number of expansion ports
4. It had a spare 2.5 inch disk slot which was not mentioned in the specs. Bonus expansion slot!
Cons:
1. Cheap internal components (Ram and SSD), though they'll definitely last the warranty period.
2. Stupid policy of not letting users open their laptop without voiding warranty. What do these people think we are? Lemmings?
3. Cheap BIOS with no features
4. No Drivers/BIOS updates on the website.

That last one is the worst, coupled with no BIOS updates which might have fixed the sleep issue. I did some investigation and the issue is that it's not going into ""s2idle"" state correctly and the BIOS only advertises that state. Windows somehow just keeps the fan running on trying to sleep which means it's going into S2 state and not ""s2idle"" which is supposed to replace S3 state.

The BIOS is very cheap and basic with no options to control sleep states, SMART reporting or other advanced features. You can at least expect sleep state control. In Linux, I'm having to use hibernate instead which works if I turn secure boot off, but it's slow.

I would avoid this brand in the future and advise others to do the same. Extremely frustrated with the experience."
21,,Acer laptop,How to enable keyboard backlight on this pc
22,,Online study,"Superb battery back 5to 6hour no heating issue
Value for money
Student ke liye best laptop"
23,,It is lagging already..,"I received this laptop with open( teared amazon box) but since laptop was untampered I let it go. Firstly, this is my first laptop so I'll just type in my experience.

It is lagging even to run prince of Persia ( which is a small game,) ..

Also there are constant lags even which doing simple stuff on this laptop.

There seems to a problem, it takes a minute to wake up from sleep mode and power button keeps blinking....I think it's an issue

The VRAM is 512 MB .... Please take my advice and don't buy this

Battery doesn't last well...it comes to 30% with only 3 hours of usage, but since it has a fast charger it gets charged quickly.

There is no backlit keyboard, and screen is worse... it'll have to be at a certain angle to view things clearly.

performance is good ( as I only used ms edge so far, yet I experienced lags while closing and adding new Tabs. I'll update more with time.

I"
24,,Disgusting Display,"The display quality is very poor; it strains the eyes so much that it causes headaches. I would not recommend buying this laptop at all. Although its specs look good, but what's the point if the display itself is so bad? I have never seen a worse display on any laptop till now. Moreover, the 16GB RAM in this laptop is in a single slot, so it's not balanced properly either. My experience with this purchase has been very disappointing."
25,,Best laptop in this price range,Best laptop in this price range
26,,Average use,"As I used over 3 month, all features are quite good, it would be much better if have free MS office."
27,,Nice,It‚Äôs good to use
28,,value for money,nice laptop for the price paid...got good exchange price also for old laptop..
29,,Everything Good except Display,"i am student so my main objective is to attend online classes which works great for me, it's very fast and snappy for day to day work.

Main issue is just display, its TN panel so don't expect too much from it, in fact its very Poor quality but for IPS display you have to spend extra 10k so considering the prize it's the best laptop you can get under 35k.

if you have a tight budget or don't want to spend too much parents' money then go for it.

Also its screen wobbles little bit under fan."

48,,AS SEEN ON Amazon,"Its exactly as it was in the described , received in good condition ,well packed.

You get 16 GB RAM, 500 GB SSD and relatively latest Ryzen 5 processor and to top it all Windows 11 OS. The only thing missing is MS Office for which you have to shell out extra, that is if one requires MS Office."

79,,Best for gaming,Due to performance this laptop is value for money. This laptop (16GB) smoothly runs GTA V in 1080p with 40fps and Valorant in 1080p with 150fps average. I did not expect such a performance.
80,,"Battery draining fast,heating issue,camera issues",Not value for money.
81,,Hard disk failed,"Hard disk currepted after one month, luckily replaced by Acer team. But volume and display changed after os installation."

84,,SSD card issue within 2 months of using. All data gone.,Excatly 2 months using it and it couldn't boot. Acer service professional said there is an issue with the SSD card and needs to be replaced. Which means I lose all my data. Not something I expect from a 60 day used laptop.
85,,Acer aspire laptop,Very nic experience laptop Acer aspire mini laptop
86,,Nice product..!,"It is a nice product by acer if you want to buy a laptop under 50000 you can consider it ,it have a amazing performance with 8 cores and 16 threads but it also have some issues. First of all because it have a ryzen processor so it have a heating problem and other is the display if we change the angle we can see the shadows on the display. Overall it is a good product with a premium design , build quality , good performance."
87,,Good,Nyc packing good quality
88,,Honest review,Thought it's very impressive that the battery is very good and is high performance but it get over heated and a little bit of laggy
89,,Worth to Buy in this price No comparison,"Laptop is good, light and fast. Box include laptop, charger and manuscript. Battery is working 4- 4.5 h. MS office was not there but in this price it is justified. I used Ryzen first time and it is working way faster. I would say in this price there is no competition with other brands."

97,,Defective item,"Within 2 hours I checked and informed to Amazon team, I have received the defective piece, no original charger, fitting is not good, battery drained veryfast. They accepted and given return confirmation as well and schedule for pickup. Beyond schedule date no one came to pick the product delivered. I reached support team multiple times but no use.

They are cheating us delivering defective items and making money"

99,,Disappointed by the product,"Recived this product with under side screws in distorted condition , seems like someone has opened it. Amazon can't be trusted anymore. I recommend don't buy expensive things on amazone. Also the body of laptop doesn't feel like metal, I think it is plastic with metal color coating."
