    text = "'Product arrived labeled as Jumbo Salted Peanuts...the peanuts were actually small sized unsalted. Not sure if this was an error or if the vendor intended to represent the product as \"Jumbo\".. My cats have been happily eating Felidae Platinum for more than two years. I just got a new bag and the shape of the food is different. They tried the new food when I first put it in their bowls and now the bowls sit full and the kitties will not touch the food. I\'ve noticed similar reviews related to formula changes in the past. Unfortunately, I now need to find a new food that my cats will eat.. The candy is just red , No flavor . Just  plan and chewy .  I would never buy them again. This oatmeal is not good. Its mushy, soft, I don\'t like it. Quaker Oats is the way to go.. Arrived in 6 days and were so stale i could not eat any of the 6 bags!!. Buyer Beware Please! This sweetener is not for everybody.  Maltitol is an alcohol sugar and can be undigestible in the body.  You will know a short time after consuming it if you are one of the unsuspecting many who cannot digest it by the extreme intestinal bloating and cramping and massive amounts of gas a person can experience. Nausea, diarrhea & headaches can also be experienced. I learned my lesson the hard way years ago when I fell in love with the sugar-free chocolates suzanne sommers used to sell.  I thought I\'d found sugar-free chocolate nirvana at first taste but the bliss was short lived when the terrible side effects of maltitol kicked in.  The discomfort was unlike anything I had ever felt before.  I blew up like a balloon and had very painful abdominal cramping.  As the symptoms passed, this too was very unpleasant.  Though hard for me to believe a low calorie sweetener could be the culprit, all symptoms were gone when I stopped eating the chocolate. My hunch it had something to do with the maltitol were unfortunately confirmed for me about a year later when I purchased some delicious sugar-free popcorn at my local market.  The taste was amazing and while I was looking at the label wondering what could possibly make this yummy, new sugarfree treat taste so good, my heart sank when I followed the little asterisk next to sugarfree sweetener* down to the very bottom of the label and read 'maltitol' in tiny little letters! Thank goodness I\'d eaten only a little. I still ended up with all the same side-effects but for a much shorter duration. Some people can use maltitol to their heart\'s content but others, like me, can have a bad reaction to it. In case you\'re like me, ... it\'s not you ...it\'s the maltitol!. No tea flavor at all. Just whole brunch of artifial flavors. It is not returnable. I wasted 20+ bucks.. I fed this to my Golden Retriever and he hated it.  He wouldn\'t eat it, and when he did, it gave him terrible diarrhea.  We will not be buying this again.  It\'s also super expensive.. These singles sell for $2.50 - $3.36 at the store for 1 box of 24 singles. I\'m not sure why Amazon is selling it for $9.99 for a box of 24 singles.  Hazelnut coffee creamer is my favorite, but truly this is not a good buy.. Seriously this product was as tasteless as they come. There are much better tasting products out there but at 100 calories its better than a special k bar or cookie snack pack. You just have to season it or combine it with something else to share the flavor.. I don\'t know how long these sat on the back of a shelf somewhere, but they were so old that they wouldn\'t cook.  I had to throw half of them out, because the skins were damaged, a clear sign of dried beans past their prime.  I can\'t even return these or ask for a refund, because food is not returnable.  Will find a different brand to use.  For now, I have about fifty servings of beans to throw away.' "
